# Introduction #

[TotalCross](https://www.toradex.com/support/partner-network/services/200011/totalcross) is an easy-to-use Open Source SDK, aimed at the fast design of beautiful Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for multiple platforms such as embedded, IoT, mobile, and desktop.

# TotalCross on Torizon #

TotalCross is available for Torizon. All modules supported by Torizon are **expected to work** since TotalCross runs on top of a graphics back-end such as Wayland, which is supported by Torizon for all Toradex SoMs. The following modules are actually **tested** by TotalCross every time a new container version is released:

- Apalis iMX8QM
- Colibri iMX7D
- Colibri iMX6DL

You can try it out with few clicks by following the instructions from the Partner Demo Container article:

- [[Partner Demo Container - TotalCross]](103589)

# TotalCross on Embedded Linux BSP #

TotalCross is available as a Yocto layer. All modules supported by Toradex are **expected to work** since TotalCross runs on top of a graphics back-end such as Wayland or X, which are supported by Toradex BSP Layers for all Toradex SoMs. The following Toradex SoMs are actually **tested** with a custom Yocto build:

- Colibri iMX6ULL
